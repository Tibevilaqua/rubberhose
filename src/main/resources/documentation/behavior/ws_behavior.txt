Importing data (Vehicle Survey Coding Challenge sample data.txt);
Renewing statistics (time when the statistics data will be renewed):
Database(mocked mongoDB(No duplicate crosses)):


Importing data:
    By default, when the application starts, the data inside the folder /resouces/data will be imported.
    This feature is managed by the method importDataFromFiles inside the class CrossCacheController.
    Obs: It's done only once (every time the application starts).

Renewing statistics:
    After importing the data, there is another method "populateStatisticsCache" in the CrossCacheController class
    which will populate the cache variables cachedDailyStatistics and cachedGeneralStatistics (daily values and week values respectively),
    by default this process runs after 6 seconds the application is started and every 5 minutes after the first insertion.
    Obs: If you want to insert some data via the "POST" endpoint and want to see the result of it straightaway, I recommend
    the reduction of every execution.


Database(MongoDB "theoretically"):
    Actually, the system is storing all the data inside the variable crossCollection in the class CrossRepository,
    the main Idea here was to simulate a MongoDB collection "cross" where duplication is not accepted.
